                        I worked in sales last several years. My job was traveling through half of Czechia to customers and providing them best knowledge and technical support. I also traveled abroad to take several trainings for many different skills.
                        <br></br>
                        I decided a few months ago to change my career and start working in IT. I never had far from computers but just a few months ago I discovered, that I enjoy programming. So I started to learn and I believe, that I can use my logical and analytical thinking in this field better.
                        There was also one tiny reason. I was fascinated by the serial Mr. Robot. 
                        <br></br>
                        I am self-educating myself through Harvard online courses. I also have a very experienced friend, that is mentoring me. For now, I have created one bigger project. Reversi logic game, where you can play against another player or against AI.
                        <br></br>
                        I am currently working on an app for managing personal finances because I never found one, that suits my needs.
